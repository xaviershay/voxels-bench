voxels-bench
============

Playing around with some ideas related to 3D cellular automata in a voxel
world.

Inside a VM on a relatively modern desktop, I can currently run a 100x100x100 simulation at 30FPS.

Make sure to use optimized builds, makes a huge difference in FPS:

    cargo run --release
